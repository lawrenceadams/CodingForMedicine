## Contributor Guidelines

If you would like to contribute an exercise to this repository, please either (A) submit an Issue or (B) submit a Pull Request of the modifed README, with your exercise added to the table.

The core principles are that all exercises should be:

1. **Highly descriptive**. All code should be explained, with minimal amounts of assumed knowledge. It should be easy to understand and complete the notebook with no reference to external material.
2. **Interactive**. Users should be prompted to modify and complete code, or experiment on their own. These are not purely 'demo' notebooks. Aspirationally, users should not be able to run front-to-back before any user modification (although not essential).
3. **Easy to run**. It should be easy and intuitive to run the notebooks both on Google Colab or on local Jupyter Notebooks.

[Here is a simple template notebook](./New_Exercise_Template.ipynb) and [here](./exercises/Coding_Medical_Calculator.ipynb) is an example of a well-designed exercise.

If there are significant amounts of code for the user to write, then template 'solution' code can be provided in the 'template_code' folder.
